HackBio Internship Stage 2 Drug Discovery with Machine Learning and Data Analysis
# Step 1
In this step, bioactivity data of acetylcholinesterase is extracted from the ChEMBL database and is preprocessed and curated for further use.
# Step 2
The SMILES notations from the data retrieved is cleaned and Lipinski's descriptors are calculated. Further, Exploratory Data Analysis is performed.
# Step 3
Fingerprint descriptors using PADEL-descriptor are calculated and tabulated.
# Step 4
Involves output data visualisation using pandas,seaborn and Scikit-learn.

Feature extraction

Model used RandomForestRegressor imported from scikit-learn

Data split into Training and Validating using scikit-learn.

Scatterplot generated using matplotlib imported from seaborn.
